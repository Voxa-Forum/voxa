Voxa is cozy community forum software that's easy to deploy, easy to manage, and focused on long-form correspondence.
It's for small communities looking to support private conversations that are less frantic and more thoughtful.
More [pre-internet BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) and less *algorithmic brain juicing for
revenue extraction*.
